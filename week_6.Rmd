## Week 6 Goals:

- Thinking about what makes a good presentation
- Incorpoating feedback and make progress on problem statement, objectives and solution design

## For next week

- next week we are going to focus on the 'storyline' of your project (and presentation)

- we will also start brainstorming about mock-up prototypes (or other was to give audience a sense of where you are going)

- put a draft presentation in [Week 7](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-9Y9etfG7ET2GW90GYDK2-EM5_7XqlEc?usp=sharing)  
  - our focus is on story (less on what the slide looks like)
  - you can just put text to describe a figure if you haven't made it yet
