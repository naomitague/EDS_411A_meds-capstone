### 1:30pm - 2:30 pm: Effective Meetings

# Meetings for Problem Solving and Project Management

In upcoming Environmental Modeling course, MEDS students will be joined by MESMs, this is a technical course with substantial data science work, mostly in R. MEDs students are generally better prepared for data science work. How should I as an instructor accommodate this?  You have 10 minutes

Quick Anonymous Poll
Did you feel that your ideas were adequately  heard?
Were you happy with the end result?
If not?  Why?

# Discuss (15 miinutes)

* Leader/facilitator as a service role
* Managing multiple voice in a short time; making sure everyone is heard
* Facilitating agreement or next steps

# Holding Meetings with your group
* Have a meeting chair who manages the agenda and discussion
* Agenda 
  * include times and who is responsible
  * collect agenda items before hand
* For each agenda item, chair should summarize (concisely) one of the following
  * information only- thanks!
  * decision reached in the discussion
  * decison not reached, 
      * what is the next step 
      * who leads
      * when due
  * progress reporting
      * next step
      * who leads
      * when due
  * more information needed
    * who
    * when
  * Useful to always have time for non-agenda, last minute items but have this at the end
 
# Meeting 2 (15 mintues)
Each MEDS Capstone project will be featured on the Bren website. By next week, your group will need to submit 1 paragraph describing your project.  You have 15 minutes to meet about this and decide how it will get done.
Previous summarizes are here [MEDS project summaries](https://bren.ucsb.edu/projects) to get an idea of what is expected.  
Then, start drafting your paragraph for the website in the shared document.

# BREAK

### More on meetings, alias, team management 2:45-4:00


## Client Meeting (15 minutes)

BEFORE next Wednesday class, have a meeting with your client 
You goal in this meeting is to clarify what the objectives are (if you have any questions)
and to address any issue with accessing data. Use this time to develop an agenda for the client meeting

For next class, you will need to bring a dataset to class to work on

* agenda (with times)
* list of clarifying questions you want to ask the client
* any issues with data - make sure

## Team alias (20 minutes)

Your team alias - a short, memorable abbreviated name for your project - serves multiple professional purposes, including: 

- The directory name on Taylor
- Your group's email prefix 
- Use in MEDS Capstone communication with faculty and staff

Spend 15 minutes brainstorming group aliases. Keep in mind that this will likely be part of a file path, so using good practices for naming things is in your best interest. Some examples of team aliases from previous Bren MESM projects are: 

- **nadatrace** (evaluated opportunities for Nada Groceries to minimize waste)
- **worthwhale** (economic valuation of whale watching & marine planning in Dominica)
- **maricultura** (assessed Brazil's aquaculture potential)
- **justhealth** (investigated relationships between air quality and diabetes risk in California)

Once you have decided on your team alias, send it to Brad & Kat so they can set up your Taylor directory and group email address. 

###  Define team roles and report back

All teams are required to have a project manager (PM) and communication manager (CM). Other roles should be decided based on project-specific needs and expectations. Discuss with your team - in addition to the PM and CM, what do you think are the most important roles for the success of the project? 

Add your proposed roles to [this shared doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19iI1BGMthN6ccFWxkMGPeT8aWXAsnonYmXkO6K9CfMM/edit#gid=0) by the end of the day. You should discuss the proposed roles with your faculty advisor, and make updates to the Googlesheet to finalize your project roles by Friday, January 11th.
