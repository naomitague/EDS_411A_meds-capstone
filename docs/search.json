Additionally, EDS 411A provides opportunities for professional and career development (e.g. presentation skills, writing and editing, client relations and project management).\nThroughout the course, students will build on skills they have learned in prior and current MEDS courses to implement them in a real-world data science project, including:\nPractice project management and reproducible workflows using tools and strategies learned in MEDS courses, establishing clear expectations for group roles and participation, and with frequent updates within and across groups\nPrepare professional presentations and documentation for a data science project through presentations for client and faculty review and through the Design and Implementation Plan, and Technical Documentation\nContinue to build real-world skills for data science projects through continued collaborative work in git, data analyses and statistics, data visualization and communication, and more\nImplement professional skills for data science careers including code and documentation peer review, team and client relations, scheduling and organizing tools & strategies, and conflict resolution & communication\nNote: Weeks 7 & 8 are practice presentations (for Faculty Reviews) and directed work on projects. Week 9 is Faculty Reviews. That’s why there aren’t shared materials for those weeks.\nMEDS Capstone Project Guidelines\n\n\n\n",
