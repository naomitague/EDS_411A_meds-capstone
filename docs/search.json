Additionally, EDS 411A provides opportunities for professional and career development (e.g. presentation skills, writing and editing, client relations and project management).\nThroughout the course, students will build on skills they have learned in prior and current MEDS courses to implement them in a real-world data science project, including:\nPractice project management and reproducible workflows using tools and strategies learned in MEDS courses, establishing clear expectations for group roles and participation, and with frequent updates within and across groups\nPrepare professional presentations and documentation for a data science project through presentations for client and faculty review and through the Design and Implementation Plan, and Technical Documentation\nContinue to build real-world skills for data science projects through continued collaborative work in git, data analyses and statistics, data visualization and communication, and more\nImplement professional skills for data science careers including code and documentation peer review, team and client relations, scheduling and organizing tools & strategies, and conflict resolution & communication\nNote: Weeks 7 & 8 are practice presentations (for Faculty Reviews) and directed work on projects. Week 9 is Faculty Reviews. That’s why there aren’t shared materials for those weeks.\n\n\n\n",

MEDs students are generally better prepared for data science work. How should I as an instructor accommodate this? You have 10 minutes\nQuick Anonymous Poll\nDid you feel that your ideas were adequately heard?\nWere you happy with the end result?\nIf not? Why?\nDiscuss (15 miinutes)\nLeader/facilitator as a service role\nManaging multiple voice in a short time; making sure everyone is heard\nFacilitating agreement or next steps\nHolding Meetings with your group\nHave a meeting chair who manages the agenda and discussion\nThe agenda\ninclude times and who is responsible\ncollect agenda items before hand\n\nFor each agenda item, chair should summarize (concisely) one of the following\ninformation only- thanks!\ndecision reached in the discussion\ndecision not reached,\nwhat is the next step\nwho leads\nwhen due\n\nprogress reporting\nnext step\nwho leads\nwhen due\n\nmore information needed\nwho is responsible\nwhen due\n\nUseful to always have time for non-agenda, last minute items but have this at the end\n\nMeeting 2 (15 mintues)\nEach MEDS Capstone project will be featured on the Bren website. By next Monday at 5pm, your group will need to submit 1 paragraph describing your project. You have 15 minutes to meet about this and decide how it will get done.\nPrevious summarizes are here MEDS project summaries to get an idea of what is expected. (See Description section)\nThen, start drafting your paragraph for the website in the shared document.\nBREAK\nMore on meetings, alias, team management 2:45-4:00\nClient Meeting (15 minutes)\nBEFORE next Wednesday class, have a meeting with your client\nYou have 3 goals in this meeting\nclarify what the objectives are (if you have any questions - know what they are before the meeting)\naddress any issue with accessing data (determine beforehand what these might be)\nfind out who the audience for your product will be and if there will be people who can test it\nUse this time to develop an agenda for the client meeting\nagenda (with times)\nlist of clarifying questions you want to ask the client\nany issues with data - make sure\nMeetings with clients\nhave an agenda, know what you want to get from the meeting be as specific as you can\nsend any materials that you would like reviewed beforehand (ideally at least 1-week)\nmake sure you have a leader for the meeting\nassign someone to take notes\nTeam alias (20 minutes)\nYour team alias - a short, memorable abbreviated name for your project - serves multiple professional purposes, including:\nYour group’s email prefix\nUse in MEDS Capstone communication with faculty and staff\nSpend 15 minutes brainstorming group aliases. Keep in mind that this will likely be part of a file path, so using good practices for naming things is in your best interest. Some examples of team aliases from previous Bren MESM projects are:\nnadatrace (evaluated opportunities for Nada Groceries to minimize waste)\nworthwhale (economic valuation of whale watching & marine planning in Dominica)\nmaricultura (assessed Brazil’s aquaculture potential)\njusthealth (investigated relationships between air quality and diabetes risk in California)\nKeep it short - 20 characters max\nKeep it professional, obvious, memorable, coder-friendly (no spaces, dashes)\nOnce you have decided on your team alias, add to MEDS 2023 Capstone Assignment\ngoogle doc\nDefine team roles and report back\nAll teams are required to have a project manager (PM) and communication manager (CM). Other roles should be decided based on project-specific needs and expectations. Discuss with your team - in addition to the PM and CM, what do you think are the most important roles for the success of the project?\nAdd your proposed roles to this shared doc by the end of the day. You should discuss the proposed roles with your faculty advisor, and make updates to the Googlesheet to finalize your project roles by Friday, January 11th.\nAnonymous - quick survey of comments on how group meetings went\nWhat you should do before next week:\nAll members should read through the MEDS Capstone Guidelines\nHold your first client meeting (by Monday) and self reflect on how it went\nBring a dataset to next Wednesday class in a software of your choice\nCreate your group alias, add to add to this shared doc by 5pm on Monday 1/11 and let Emily know by Monday 5pm\nFinalize your summary paragraph for the Bren website, add to this shared doc by 5pm on Monday 1/11 and send to Emily know by Monday 5pm\nMake sure your project roles are updated on the shared Googlesheet and let Emily know by Monday 5pm\nEmily is case@bren.ucsb.edu\n\n\n\n",
